## Tutorial From Udemy About React And Redux

This was a project in the Modern React with redux course from Udemy, so far this course has been very rewarding.

```
	> npm install
	> npm start
```

goto openweathermap.org and request a new api. Then in the root of the project

```
  > touch apikey.js
```

In the api key file

```
  export default const API_KEY = <YOUR API KEY HERE> ;
```


### The Purpose of this app is to take user input and return the relevant weather data from the API.
